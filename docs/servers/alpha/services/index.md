# Introduction

This section details the installation and configuration of all the services run by the server. All of these services are run through [Docker](../setting-up/docker.md), so make sure you have it set up before reading any further.

## Configuration

All services will be located in the home folder. In order to be a bit more *organized*, we'll create a folder for everything:

```bash
mkdir ~/services
```
