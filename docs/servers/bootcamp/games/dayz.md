# DayZ

Use [this script](https://github.com/moonstar-x/game-server-updater) to install the game server.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmoonstar-x%2Fgame-server-updater%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2Fservers%2Fdayz.py&style=github&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## Configuration

Inside the server folder you should create a `scripts` folder and then use subfolders for each server configuration you need. In my case, one of my subfolders is named `regular`.  Inside this subfolder, you should have a `server.cfg` file. You can base yourself off the following:

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmoonstar-x%2Fserver-configs%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fdayz%2Fregular%2Fserver.cfg&style=github&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>

## Running the Server

To run this server you should create a script inside the subfolder of the `scripts` folder. In my case, one of my subfolders is named `regular`. Inside this subfolder, you should have a `start.bat` file. You can base yourself off the following:

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmoonstar-x%2Fserver-configs%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fdayz%2Fregular%2Fstart.bat&style=github&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>
