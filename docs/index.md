# Introduction

This is a simple guide that focuses on the installation and configuration process of my little home server that runs multiple services for various purposes. The server now uses Docker for most of its services. This is an improved version of the [previous server guide](https://moonstar-x.dev/old-server-setup), some of the services from the previous version are present here, some are gone for good.
