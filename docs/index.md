# Introduction

This is a simple guide that focuses on the installation and configuration process of my little home server that runs multiple services for various purposes composed of two computers. The server now uses Docker for most of its services. This is an improved version of the [previous server guide](https://moonstar-x.dev/old-server-setup), some of the services from the previous version are present here, some are gone for good.

As you will notice, this server setup is actually composed of multiple devices with specific roles. That go along the lines of:

> * [Alpha (Main Server)](./servers/alpha/setting-up/index.md)
>
> Hosts most of the services I use for my personal (and shared) use.
>
> * [Delta (Discord Deployments)](./servers/delta/setting-up/index.md)
>
> Hosts my personal Discord bot deployments.
