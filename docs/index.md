# Introduction

This is a guide that focuses on the installation and configuration process of my self-hosted infrastructure that runs some custom services that I use.

As you'll notice, this setup is actually composed of multiple servers with specific roles, all of which use Docker exclusively.

Currently, these are the servers available:

- [deploy-us-east-1](./servers/deploy-us-east-1/configuration/index.md)
- [dev-ec-uio-1](./servers/dev-ec-uio-1/configuration/index.md)
- [dev-eu-west-1](./servers/dev-eu-west-1/configuration/index.md)
- [misc-ec-uio-1](./servers/misc-ec-uio-1/configuration/index.md)
- [misc-us-east-1](./servers/misc-us-east-1/configuration/index.md)
