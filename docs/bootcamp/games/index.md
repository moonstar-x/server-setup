# Introduction

This section describes the game servers installed on the Windows partition of the Mac Mini server.

Game server installation is based off my own [game-server-updater](https://github.com/moonstar-x/game-server-updater) script. You can check it out if you're interested on using it.

Further sections for game servers downloaded with SteamCMD will include the commands necessary to install them since the script already includes them. This guide assumes you're using said script to install the servers.

If you're interested, I have uploaded all the configs for these servers in a [separate repo](https://github.com/moonstar-x/server-configs) which are referenced all over the following sections.
