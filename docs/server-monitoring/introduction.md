# Introduction

Since I had a Raspberry Pi 3B+ laying around collecting dust, I decided to use it as an always-on monitoring service using [Prometheus](in-server/prometheus.md) and [Grafana](in-monitor/grafana.md). The idea would be that the server would report data about its current usage and Grafana would display a pretty dashboard containing all the relevant data to give a better insight on the server's current usage.

This section of the guide is meant to be followed in the order that is displayed in the content sidebar. It is separated by the machine that has to run the corresponding service.
