# Initialization

The following section contains the guides that should be applied on the monitor device. In this case, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ will be used since it is a low profile and low consumption device, which fits perfectly for this always-on monitoring system.

If you're using a Raspberry Pi 3B+, I recommend you follow the [Configuration](./configuration.md) page, otherwise you may be able to skip it. Keep in mind that the [Grafana](./grafana.md) service will run through Docker, so you should install it there too if you don't already have it.
