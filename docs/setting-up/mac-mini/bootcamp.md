[Bootcamp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) is a tool made by Apple to allow users to dual boot Windows on their Intel based Mac computers.

The assistant comes already installed on all macOS version, so there is no need to install anything else.

This page will not describe the process of installing Windows since it's mostly straightforward.

You can acquire Windows 10 image from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

For our use case, we're leaving macOS with 150GB and Windows with 100GB on the main drive.
